# Desktop Updates

Desktop updates use GitHub releases and expose both a startup upgrade action and a Settings auto-upgrade preference.

The Electron main process configures `electron-updater` against the repository publisher metadata from `electron-builder.yml`, which points at `fathah/hermes-desktop`. [[src/main/app/updater.ts#setupUpdater]] registers update IPC handlers, persists the auto-upgrade preference under Electron `userData`, and applies that preference to `autoUpdater.autoDownload`.

When GitHub reports a newer release, [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] shows an upgrade button in the sidebar footer as soon as the app reaches the main layout. The button downloads the update when needed, shows download progress, and changes into a restart action after the update is ready.

[[src/renderer/src/components/settings/AboutPane.tsx#AboutPane]] (the About & Updates pane of the settings modal) presents the desktop app as its own card, separate from the Hermes Agent engine card — the two update on independent channels. The card shows the app version, the auto-upgrade toggle, and an explicit update action: [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/useSettingsData.ts#useSettingsData]] subscribes to the same `onUpdateAvailable`/`onUpdateDownloadProgress`/`onUpdateDownloaded`/`onUpdateError` events as the footer button and adds a manual `checkDesktopUpdate` (via `checkForUpdates`) plus a `handleDesktopUpdate` that downloads, then restarts via `installUpdate`. When auto-upgrade is enabled the startup release check downloads automatically; when disabled, downloading waits for the user's click (footer button or this card's action).
